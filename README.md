### 👋 Hi! I'm Jack.

I'm a **Senior Full Stack Developer** specialising in **TypeScript**, **GraphQL**, **event-driven architecture** and working towards the **perfect developer experience**.

I specialise in architecting high-performance, event-driven, and distributed systems, finding great fun working with AWS, RabbitMQ, Redis, Golang, and a wide variety of tech stacks.

Here's a couple of things that I'm keeping busy with:

- 👨🏻‍💻 Working as a **Senior Full Stack Developer** at **[Social Energy](https://social.energy)**.
- 🎹 Creating **[MIDI Mixer](https://midi-mixer.com)**, a Windows app that lets you control application volumes using MIDI.
- ✍🏻 Writing blog posts over at **[my notebook](https://jpwilliams.dev)**.
- 🌱 Learning the **Flying Trapeze**.
