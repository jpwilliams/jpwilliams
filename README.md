### 👋 Hi! I'm Jack.

I'm a **software developer** specialising in **Node.js** along with large portions of experience (and fun) working with **React** and **React Native**.

Here's a couple of things that I'm keeping busy with:

- 👨🏻‍💻 Working as a Full Stack Developer at **[Social Energy](https://social.energy)**.
- 🎹 Creating **[MIDI Mixer](https://midi-mixer.com)**, a Windows app that lets you control application volumes using MIDI.
- ✍🏻 Writing tech blog posts over at **[my notebook](https://jpwilliams.dev)**.
- 🌱 Learning **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)**.
