### 👋 Hi! I'm Jack.

I'm a **Founding Engineer** at **[Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/)** working to bring the benefits of event-driven architecture to the masses.

I ❤️ **TypeScript**, **GraphQL**, **event-driven architecture** (obviously), and working towards the **perfect developer experience**, specialising in architecting high-performance, distributed systems.

Here are a few things I'm keeping busy with:

- 👨🏻‍💻 Working as a **Founding Engineer** at **[Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/)**.
- 🎹 Creating **[MIDI Mixer](https://midi-mixer.com)**, a Windows app that lets you control application volumes using MIDI.
- ✍🏻 Writing blog posts over at **[my notebook](https://jpwilliams.dev)**.
- 🌱 Learning the **Flying Trapeze**.
