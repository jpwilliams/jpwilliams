### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **software developer** specialising in **Node.js** along with large portions of experience (and fun) working with **React** and **React Native**.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Svelte, figuring out cool things to do with Cloudflare Workers, and making [MIDI Mixer](https://mixi-mixer.com).
